# Echoear: AI-Powered Heart Health Estimation

**Echoear** is an AI application designed to estimate **Pulmonary Artery Pressure (PAP)** and **Ejection Fraction (EF)** of the heart, providing insights similar to traditional echocardiography. By analyzing stethoscope signals, Echoear makes heart health monitoring more accessible, non-invasive, and mobile.

## Project Overview

Echoear brings the capabilities of advanced heart health monitoring to portable stethoscopes. By combining AI-driven audio analysis with Bluetooth-enabled stethoscope technology, Echoear provides real-time estimates of PAP and EF, helping individuals monitor their heart health with greater ease.

### Key Features

- **Accurate PAP Estimation**: Uses advanced algorithms to estimate pulmonary artery pressure.
- **EF Calculation**: Provides reliable ejection fraction measurements for heart health insights.
- **Non-Invasive and Portable**: Requires only stethoscope signals, eliminating the need for ultrasound or other equipment.
